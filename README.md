Basic Overview and Features
---------------------------
The goal of this website is to provide patrons an easier way to search for DVDs and VHSs available at the Jones Media Center online. The website's homescreen is a set of promotional movies that change based on holidays. Patrons can search by genre under the "Search by Genre" tab by clicking on one of the genres. Patrons can also search by keyword by entering a keyword in the search box. The website pulls the information from the Dartmouth Library Catalog and reformats it so that it is displayed in a more visual appealing manner.
